# Exoplanet-Identification-Model
Identifying exoplanets using ensemble learning in machine learning is an exciting application that can leverage the strengths of various algorithms to improve prediction accuracy. The proposed Automl-based methodologies simplify model development and enhance model performance by automatically selecting suitable algorithms and hyperparameters, improving classification accuracy and generalization to unseen data. Automl tools like Pycaret, Autokeras, MLJAR supervised, and H2O.AI are been compared in this project. Pycaret has been selected as the best Automl tool with an accuracy of 98.03% and an F1 score of 98.02%
